Exercise 9 of the "C# Class Development" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Problem 1 – Extracting the Pyramid Slot Number

Create a new console application named Exercise9.

Read in a string from the user in the following format:

<pyramid slot number>,<block letter>,<whether or not the block should be lit>

Example:

15,M,true

Use the String methods you can read about in the documentation to extract the pyramid slot number from the string and store it in a variable.

Print the pyramid slot number. This is a number, so you should NOT be saving it as a string!

Problem 2 – Extracting the Block Letter

Extract the block letter from the string and store it in a variable.

Print the block letter. This is a single character, so you should NOT be saving it as a string!

Problem 3 – Extracting Whether Or Not the Block Should Be Lit

Extract whether or not the block should be lit from the string and store it in a variable. This is a Boolean value, so you should NOT be saving it as a string!

You are NOT allowed to use the LastIndexOf method to do this. (Hint: Use the Substring method to shorten the original input string)

Print whether or not the block should be lit.
